Automated deployment for DeepCortex platform

1) Create a folder called environments on your computer.

2) Place the deepcortex-settings.tfvars file under this "environmnets" directory.

3) Fill in the necessary variables in deepcortex-settings.tfvars.

4) Export the following variables in your terminal.

CONFIG - the name of the config file to use (should be deepcortex-settings).
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID - the access key that should be used to deploy in AWS.
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - the secret key that should be used to deploy in AWS.
CUSTOMER_KEY - the DC/OS enterprise key
DCOS_USERNAME - the username you'd like to use to login to the DC/OS cluster
DCOS_PASSWORD - the password you'd like to use to login to the DC/OS cluster

5) Run "docker login -u falcondeepcortex"

6) Run "docker pull deepcortex/scorpius-deployment:<TAG>" repalcing tag with the correct image tag.

7) Run the following docker command replacing /path/to/environments with the path to the environments directory you created in step 1 and TAG with the correct version of the docker image.

docker run --rm \
  -v ~/environments:/opt/deploy/environments \
  -e CONFIG=${CONFIG} \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID} \
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY} \
  -e CUSTOMER_KEY=${CUSTOMER_KEY} \
  -e DCOS_USERNAME=${DCOS_USERNAME} \
  -e DCOS_PASSWORD=${DCOS_PASSWORD} \
  deepcortex/scorpius-deployment
